# 3d-soft-engine-lua (WIP)

> A simple 3D engine using [lua-fenster](https://github.com/jonasgeiler/lua-fenster) and written in Lua.

Some time ago I wanted to learn more about 3D engines, so I read this tutorial series by David Rousset and then translated the TypeScript code from the tutorial series into Lua:
[Tutorial series: learning how to write a 3D soft engine from scratch in C#, TypeScript or JavaScript](https://www.davrous.com/2013/06/13/tutorial-series-learning-how-to-write-a-3d-soft-engine-from-scratch-in-c-typescript-or-javascript/)
