# 3d-rasterizer-lua (WIP)

A simple 3D Software Engine made in Lua with [lua-fenster](https://github.com/jonasgeiler/lua-fenster).

I followed this tutorial by David Rousset, and translated it to Lua:

## To Do

- [ ] Use class utility from 3d-raytracer-lua
- [ ] Refactor lib/babylon.lua for new class utility and convention
- [ ] Get rid of lib/bit.lua and use BitOp instead
- [ ] Replace lib/json.lua with a good lib from luarocks
